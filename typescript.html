JavaScript was introduced as a language for the client side. The development 
of Node.js has marked JavaScript as an emerging server-side technology too.
However, as JavaScript code grows, it tends to get messier, making it difficult 
to maintain and reuse the code. Moreover, its failure to embrace the features 
of Object Orientation, strong type checking and compile-time error checks prevents
JavaScript from succeeding at the enterprise level as a full-fledged server-side 
technology. TypeScript was presented to bridge this gap.


**TYPESCRIPT

var message:string = "Hello World" 
console.log(message)
OR
var num:number = 12 
console.log(num)

**JAVASCRIPT
var message = "Hello World";
console.log(message);
OR
var num = 12;
console.log(num);

What is TypeScript?

By definition, “TypeScript is JavaScript for application-scale development.”

TypeScript is a strongly typed, object oriented, compiled language. It was 
designed by Anders Hejlsberg (designer of C#) at Microsoft. TypeScript is 
both a language and a set of tools. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript 
compiled to JavaScript. In other words, TypeScript is JavaScript plus some additional features.
